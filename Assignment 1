Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

1. Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is a branch of computer science used for developing, testing, and maintaining software.

Reliability – Ensures software performs as expected without bias, especially for critical applications like healthcare and finance.

Efficiency – Optimizes developer workflow while maintaining high-quality standards.

Scalability and Flexibility – Ensures that the system can handle an increased load without affecting performance.

Security – Implements protection practices like authentication, authorization, and encryption to secure user information.


2. Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

Mastering Complexity – The need for structured programming and methodologies to manage complex systems.

Mastering Process – The introduction of Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) methodologies like Waterfall and Agile.

Mastering Machines – Advances in hardware and cloud computing enabled new possibilities, including distributed systems and AI-driven development.


3. List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).

Planning – Identify the software requirements, purpose, and scope.

Requirement Analysis – Identify and document user specifications.

Design – Build the architectural framework.

Coding – Convert the software design into functional code.

Testing – Examine the software for any bugs and glitches.


4. Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall Methodology

Linear and sequential – each phase is completed before moving to the next.

Low flexibility – changes are difficult to incorporate once a phase is complete.

Customer feedback comes late – only after the product is developed.

Testing is done at the end of the development process.
Example: Best suited for projects with well-defined requirements, such as government or legal systems.


Agile Methodology

Iterative and incremental – multiple cycles (sprints).

High flexibility – adapts to changing requirements.

Regular customer feedback is incorporated at every sprint.

Testing is continuous after each iteration.
Example: Best for fast-changing environments, such as mobile app development.


5. Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developer

Develops applications, programs, and systems using programming languages and frameworks.

Maintains and updates software.

Collaborates with other team members to ensure best practices.

Reports progress to the project manager.


Quality Assurance Engineer

Understands and clarifies software requirements with stakeholders.

Develops testing standards and procedures.

Confirms that the software meets requirements before deployment.

Identifies bugs and suggests improvements.

Automates testing using open-source tools.


Project Manager

Leads the software development team.

Discusses project requirements with clients and developers.

Creates a blueprint for the project.

Tracks project milestones and communicates progress.

Oversees deployment and monitors software performance.


6. Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)

Example: Visual Studio Code (VSCode)
Importance:

Helps structure code correctly with syntax highlighting and auto-completion.

Formats code for readability and provides instant feedback on errors.

Automates compiling, unit testing, and debugging to improve productivity.


Version Control Systems (VCS)

Example: Git
Importance:

Collaboration – Enables multiple developers to work on the same codebase.

Change Tracking – Keeps a detailed history of code modifications.

Branching and Merging – Allows parallel development of new features.

Error Recovery – Enables reverting to previous versions if issues arise.


7. What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Rapid Technological Advancement – Continuous learning and using agile methodologies.

Time Constraints – Agile workflows (e.g., Scrum) to divide tasks into manageable sprints.

Limited Infrastructure – Investing in high-performance tools and cloud computing.

Changing Software Requirements – Adopting modular design and iterative development.

Security Risks – Implementing encryption, authentication, and threat mitigation strategies.

Usability Issues – Prioritizing user-friendly design and accessibility.


8. Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit Testing – Tests individual components to ensure functionality.

Integration Testing – Checks interactions between different modules.

System Testing – Verifies overall software performance and compliance with requirements.

Acceptance Testing – Confirms the software meets user needs before deployment.


Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

1. Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is the process of crafting instructions to guide AI models in generating desired outputs.

Importance:

Improved User Experience – Ensures relevant responses on the first attempt.

Increased Flexibility – Helps AI adapt to different contexts.

Developer Control – Enhances accuracy by refining AI interactions.


2. Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague Prompt: "Draw a picture of a person."
Improved Prompt: "Draw a full-body portrait of a young woman with long brown hair, wearing a red jacket and blue jeans, standing in a park on a sunny day with trees and grass in the background."

Why is the improved prompt better?

Clarity – Specifies what is needed (a full-body portrait).

Specific Details – Describes appearance (hair color, clothing) and setting (park, trees, sunny day).

Conciseness – Provides clear guidance without unnecessary complexity.
